Guess What Letter I'm Thinking Of!

This was inspired by Coding Boot Camp Javascript assignment and week 3 class activities. I chose to store the available choices in a string instead of an array because I think the code for choosing a random letter from the string is simpler.

During development, I made heavy use of the console to check results. You can view the output of each block of code while the game is ongoing, and you can also "cheat" by viewing the computer's guess in teh console. Doing this allowed me to find and vanquish a bug where a round would end, but the computer didn't choose a new random letter.
